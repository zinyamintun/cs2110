/** This class contains simple methods for you to learn<br>

 * Most methods have a comment at the beginning of the body giving you<br>
 * instructions for writing it and perhaps showing you where to look in<br>

 * Each function body has in it a return statement. Without it, the function<br>

 *
 * After you complete a method, look at the procedure in A2Test.java that <br>
 * tests it. Click on the name of the function. Then use menu item Run -> Run. <br>
 * That method will be called to test whether you wrote the method correctly.
